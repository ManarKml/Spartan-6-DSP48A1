The Spartan-6 family offers a high ratio of DSP48A1 slices to logic, making it ideal for math-intensive applications. The DSP48A1 slice contains an 18-bit input pre-adder followed by an 18 x 18 bit two's complement multiplier and a 48-bit sign-extended adder/subtracter/accumulator, a function that is widely used in digital signal processing. It has many subtle features that enhance the usefulness, versatility, and speed of this arithmetic building block. The testbench for this design was done using directed test patterns to verify the designed block.

Using a do file to run the Questasim flow and Vivado to go through the design flow running elaboration, synthesis, implementation making sure that there are no design check errors during the design flow. Source of the requirements: [Link](https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/ug389)
